two_digit_number = input()
first_digit = int(two_digit_number[0])
second_digit = int(two_digit_number[1])

# Add the two integers together
two_digit_number = first_digit + second_digit

BMI Calculator
  # 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
height = input()
# 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72
weight = input()
weight_as_int = int(weight)
height_as_float = float(height)
#Using the exponent operator **
bmi = weight_as_int / height_as_float ** 2
# Using multiplication and PEMDAS
bmi= weight_as_int / (height_as_float * height_as_float)

bmi_as_int = int(bmi)
print(bmi_as_int)

Life in Weeks
age = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
years = 90 - int(age)
weeks = years * 52
print(f"You Have {weeks} left.")


Day 2 Project- Tip Calculator
print("Welcome to the tip calculator") 
bill=float(input("What was the total bill $"))
tip=int(input("What tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15?"))
people=int(input("How many people to split the bill?"))
tip_as_percent=tip/100
total_tip_amount=bill*tip_as_percent
total_bill=bill+total_tip_amount
bill_per_person=total_bill/people
final_amount=round(bill_per_person, 2)
print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}")

Example:
What was the total bill $1800
What tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15?12
How many people to split the bill?9
Each person should pay: $224.0
