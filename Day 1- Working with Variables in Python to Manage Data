#Band Name Generator:
  #1. Create a greeting for your program.
  #2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
  #3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.

  city=input("Which city did you grown up in?\n")
  pet=input("What is the name of a pet?\n")
  print("Your band name could be "+city+" "+pet)
